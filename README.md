# Mischievous Door

A simple program where everytime someone walks through a door this python script will minimize every single window except the Google Chrome window that opens when the program is executed. You can put anything on this window to make it look like you are doing something productive. You can edit this project to your needs!

## Note: this program only works if you have a webserver that returns the status of a sensor on a door. This script is for demonstration purposes only. Extra configuration is needed.

## Install & Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PoseidonCoder/mischievous-door.git
cd mischievous-door
pip install -r requirements.txt
py main.py
```
